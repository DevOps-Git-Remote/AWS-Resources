Great! Weâ€™ll go step by step, covering each topic in detail. Let's start with the first topic:  

## **1. AWS Cloud Concepts**  
This section covers the basics of cloud computing, AWS global infrastructure, and the benefits of using AWS.

### **What is Cloud Computing?**  
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

### **Benefits of Cloud Computing:**  
1. **Scalability** â€“ Automatically scale up or down as needed.  
2. **Agility** â€“ Deploy applications quickly without worrying about infrastructure.  
3. **Cost Savings** â€“ Pay only for what you use (no upfront hardware costs).  
4. **Elasticity** â€“ Automatically adjust resources based on demand.  
5. **Security** â€“ AWS provides strong security measures like IAM, encryption, and compliance.  
6. **Global Reach** â€“ Access AWS services worldwide through multiple data centers.  

---

### **AWS Global Infrastructure**  
AWS is built on a global network of data centers to ensure high availability and low latency.

1. **Regions** â€“ A geographical area (e.g., us-east-1, ap-south-1). Each region has multiple data centers.  
2. **Availability Zones (AZs)** â€“ A group of one or more isolated data centers within a region.  
3. **Edge Locations** â€“ AWS data centers that cache content closer to users (used by CloudFront for fast content delivery).  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** If you host an application in **US-East (Virginia) with 3 Availability Zones**, AWS ensures high availability even if one AZ goes down.

---

### **Types of Cloud Computing Models**  
AWS offers different cloud computing models based on customer needs:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** â€“ Provides virtual servers, storage, and networking (e.g., Amazon EC2, S3).  
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** â€“ Provides a fully managed environment for developing apps (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda).  
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** â€“ Ready-to-use applications over the cloud (e.g., AWS WorkSpaces, Gmail, Office 365).

Awesome! Let's explore AWS Global Infrastructure using the AWS Console by checking regions and deploying a small EC2 instance.  

---

### **Step 1: Sign in to AWS Console**  
1. Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).  
2. Sign in with your AWS account. If you donâ€™t have one, create a free-tier account.

### **Step 3: Launch a Small EC2 Instance (Virtual Server)**  
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) allows you to create virtual machines in AWS.  

1. **Go to EC2 Service**:  
   - In the AWS Console, search for **EC2** and open it.  
   - Click **Launch Instance** to start creating a virtual machine.  

2. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**:  
   - Select **Amazon Linux 2023 (Free Tier Eligible)**.  

3. **Choose Instance Type**:  
   - Select **t2.micro (Free Tier Eligible)** (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM).  

4. **Configure Instance Details**:  
   - Keep everything default and proceed.  

5. **Add Storage**:  
   - Keep default **8GB** storage.  

6. **Configure Security Group**:  
   - Create a new security group to allow **SSH (port 22)** for remote access.  

7. **Launch Instance**:  
   - Click **Launch** and **Create a New Key Pair** (download the .pem file).  
   - Click **Launch Instance**.  

---

### **Step 4: Connect to Your EC2 Instance**  
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard â†’ Instances** and wait for your instance to reach the **Running** state.  
2. Select your instance â†’ Click **Connect**.  
3. Use **EC2 Instance Connect** (works in-browser, no setup needed).  
4. Click **Connect**, and youâ€™ll see a terminal window with your instance.  

---

### **Step 5: Run Basic Commands**  
Once connected, run these basic Linux commands:  
```bash
# Check system info
uname -a  

# Check disk space
df -h  

# Check running processes
top  
```

### **Next Steps**  
Would you like to:  
âœ… **Learn how to install a web server (Apache/Nginx) on EC2**?  
âœ… **Understand how to attach Elastic IP and connect via SSH using PuTTY**?  
âœ… **Move to the next AWS Cloud Practitioner topic (Security & IAM)**?  

Let me know what you'd like to explore next!

Great! Let's install a web server (Apache) on your EC2 instance and access a simple webpage over the internet.  

---

## **Step 1: Install Apache Web Server**  
Once connected to your EC2 instance via **EC2 Instance Connect** or SSH, run the following commands:  

### **1. Update the package manager**  
```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

### **2. Install Apache (httpd)**
```bash
sudo yum install -y httpd
```

### **3. Start and enable Apache**  
```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

### **4. Verify Apache is running**  
```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```
You should see a message confirming that Apache is **active (running)**.

## **Step 2: Configure Firewall to Allow HTTP Traffic**
1. Modify the **Security Group** attached to your instance:  
   - In the AWS console, go to **EC2 Dashboard â†’ Instances**.  
   - Click on your instance, scroll down to **Security**, and click on the **Security Group**.  
   - Click **Edit inbound rules** â†’ **Add Rule**.  
   - Choose:  
     - **Type:** HTTP  
     - **Protocol:** TCP  
     - **Port Range:** 80  
     - **Source:** 0.0.0.0/0 (anyone can access it)  
   - Click **Save rules**.  

2. Restart Apache to apply changes:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

---

## **Step 3: Create a Simple Webpage**
1. Navigate to the Apache web root directory:  
```bash
cd /var/www/html
```
2. Create an `index.html` file:  
```bash
sudo nano index.html
```
3. Add the following content inside the file:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First AWS Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my Apache Web Server on AWS EC2!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
4. Save the file (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).  

---

## **Step 4: Access Your Web Page**
1. Copy the **Public IPv4 address** of your EC2 instance from the AWS console.  
2. Open a web browser and enter:  
   ```
   http://<your-public-ip>
   ```
3. You should see **"Welcome to my Apache Web Server on AWS EC2!"**  

---

### **Next Steps**
Would you like to:  
âœ… **Attach an Elastic IP to make the instanceâ€™s IP permanent?**  
âœ… **Learn how to connect using SSH via PuTTY?**  
âœ… **Move to the next AWS topic: Security & IAM?**  

Let me know what you'd like to do next!

Let's go step by step on **attaching an Elastic IP to your EC2 instance** and **connecting via SSH using PuTTY** before moving on to Security & IAM.  

---

# **Step 1: Attach an Elastic IP to Your EC2 Instance**  
By default, your EC2 instance gets a **dynamic public IP** that changes when you stop/start the instance. An **Elastic IP** is a static public IP that remains the same.

### **1. Allocate an Elastic IP**  
1. In the **AWS Console**, go to **EC2 Dashboard**.  
2. In the left menu, click on **Elastic IPs** under **Network & Security**.  
3. Click **Allocate Elastic IP Address** â†’ Choose **Amazonâ€™s pool of IPv4 addresses** â†’ Click **Allocate**.  
4. Copy the newly allocated Elastic IP.

### **2. Associate the Elastic IP with Your EC2 Instance**  
1. Select the allocated Elastic IP.  
2. Click **Actions** â†’ **Associate Elastic IP Address**.  
3. Choose:  
   - **Instance:** Select your running EC2 instance.  
   - **Private IP:** The default private IP (leave unchanged).  
4. Click **Associate**.  

âœ… Now, your EC2 instance has a permanent public IP!  

### **3. Update Your Browser Test**
- Open your web browser and replace the old public IP with the new **Elastic IP**.  
- You should still see your Apache web page.  

---

# **Step 2: Connect to Your EC2 Instance Using PuTTY (Windows Users)**
PuTTY is a popular SSH client for Windows.

### **1. Convert .pem Key to .ppk Format**
1. Download and install **PuTTY** and **PuTTYgen** ([Download here](https://www.putty.org/)).  
2. Open **PuTTYgen** â†’ Click **Load**.  
3. Select **"All Files"** and choose your `.pem` key file (downloaded when launching EC2).  
4. Click **Save Private Key** â†’ Name it **aws-key.ppk** â†’ Click **Yes** when warned about no passphrase.  

---

### **2. Connect to EC2 Using PuTTY**
1. Open **PuTTY**.  
2. In **Host Name**, enter:  
   ```
   ec2-user@<Elastic-IP>
   ```
3. Under **Connection â†’ SSH â†’ Auth**, browse and select your **aws-key.ppk** file.  
4. Click **Open** â†’ If prompted, click **Yes**.  
5. You should see a terminal logged in as **ec2-user**.  

âœ… Now, youâ€™re connected to your EC2 instance using PuTTY!
