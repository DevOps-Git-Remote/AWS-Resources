# **Amazon CloudFront ‚Äì Deep Dive**  

Amazon **CloudFront** is a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users with **low latency and high transfer speeds**.  

It uses **Edge Locations** to **cache** content **closer to users**, reducing the load on origin servers and improving website/app performance.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ How CloudFront Works?**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Requests Content**  
   - A user requests an **image, video, or webpage** from `www.example.com`.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **CloudFront Checks the Edge Cache**  
   - If the content is cached at a nearby **Edge Location**, it is served immediately (Fast & Low Latency).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **If Not Cached, CloudFront Fetches from Origin**  
   - If the requested content is **not in cache**, CloudFront retrieves it from the **Origin Server** (e.g., **S3, EC2, ALB**).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **CloudFront Caches the Content**  
   - The fetched content is cached at the Edge Location for future requests.  

üìå **Example:**  
- A user in **India** requests an image from `example.com`.  
- CloudFront **checks the nearest Edge Location** (e.g., Mumbai).  
- If the image is **cached**, it is delivered instantly.  
- If not, it is fetched from **S3 in us-east-1**, then cached in Mumbai for the next request.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Components of CloudFront**  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Edge Locations** | Data centers where CloudFront caches content |
| **Regional Edge Caches** | Additional caching layers before reaching origin |
| **Origin Server** | The source of content (e.g., S3, EC2, ALB, API Gateway) |
| **Distribution** | A CloudFront setup that routes user requests |
| **Cache Behavior** | Rules to control caching, compression, and request forwarding |
| **TTL (Time to Live)** | Defines how long content stays in cache before updating |

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ CloudFront Distributions**  

CloudFront **Distributions** define how content is served.

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Web Distribution** | Delivers **web content (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos)** |
| **RTMP Distribution** (Deprecated) | Previously used for **media streaming** (now use Web Distribution + Media Services) |

üìå **Example:**  
- You want to deliver a website‚Äôs images faster.  
- You create a **Web Distribution** pointing to an **S3 bucket**.  
- CloudFront **caches the images** at Edge Locations worldwide.  

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Supported Origins**  
CloudFront fetches content from various **origin servers**:

| Origin | Example Use Case |
|--------|------------------|
| **Amazon S3** | Static website hosting, media storage |
| **EC2 Instances** | Dynamic content like API responses |
| **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB)** | Distribute requests across multiple servers |
| **API Gateway** | Securely serve APIs with caching |
| **On-Premise Servers** | Extend CloudFront to your own data center |

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Caching in CloudFront**  

CloudFront **caches content** at Edge Locations based on rules:  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **TTL (Time-to-Live)** | Controls cache expiration time |
| **Cache Invalidation** | Clears cached objects manually |
| **Query String Forwarding** | Determines if query parameters affect cache behavior |
| **Origin Shield** | Extra layer of caching between Edge Locations & Origin |

### **üìå Example ‚Äì Cache Settings**
- **Static Content (Images, CSS, JS)**  
  - Set **TTL = 24 hours** (long cache).  
- **Dynamic Content (API Responses, HTML)**  
  - Set **TTL = 0 seconds** (no caching).

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ CloudFront Security Features**  

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **AWS WAF** | Protects against web attacks (SQL injection, XSS) |
| **AWS Shield** | Defends against DDoS attacks |
| **Signed URLs & Signed Cookies** | Restricts access to premium content |
| **Origin Access Control (OAC)** | Secures S3 content to be accessed only via CloudFront |
| **Field-Level Encryption** | Protects sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) |

üìå **Example: Restrict S3 Access Using CloudFront**  
- Instead of making an **S3 bucket public**, use CloudFront with **Origin Access Control (OAC)**.  
- Now, only **CloudFront can fetch S3 content**, preventing direct access.

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ CloudFront Routing Policies**  

| Routing Feature | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| **Geo Restriction** | Blocks content access from specific countries |
| **Lambda@Edge** | Runs serverless functions at Edge Locations |
| **Custom Headers** | Adds security/authentication headers |
| **Compression (Gzip, Brotli)** | Reduces content size for faster delivery |

üìå **Example: Geo Restriction**  
- A video streaming website should only be available in **India & US**.  
- Set up **Geo Restriction** to block users from other countries.

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Hands-On: Setting Up CloudFront for an S3 Website**  

### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a **public S3 bucket** (or use **OAC** for security).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload an `index.html` file.  

### **Step 2: Create a CloudFront Distribution**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to **CloudFront ‚Üí Create Distribution**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Set **Origin** as your S3 bucket.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable **OAC** (if using private S3).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Set **TTL = 86400** (1 day caching).  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Click **Create**.  

### **Step 3: Test CloudFront URL**
- Find the **CloudFront URL** (e.g., `https://d123abc.cloudfront.net`).  
- Open it in a browser ‚Äì your **S3 website is now served globally via CloudFront!**

## **üîü CloudFront Pricing**  

CloudFront follows **pay-as-you-go pricing**, based on:  

| Pricing Factor | Cost Impact |
|---------------|------------|
| **Data Transfer** | Charged per GB served from Edge Locations |
| **Requests** | Number of HTTP/S requests |
| **Invalidations** | Clearing cache costs extra if exceeding free limit |
| **Lambda@Edge** | Extra cost for serverless functions at the edge |

üìå **Cost Optimization Tips**  
‚úÖ **Use AWS Free Tier** (50GB data transfer free).  
‚úÖ **Set longer TTL for static content** (reduces origin fetches).  
‚úÖ **Enable Origin Shield** (reduces direct origin hits).  

---

## **üîπ Summary**
